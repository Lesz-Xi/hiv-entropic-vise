Below are key sources supporting each point, followed by a consolidated BibTeX list.

QVOA underestimates the HIV latent reservoir: reviews and primary studies conclude standard single‑round QVOA provides a minimal estimate because many replication‑competent proviruses are not induced under a given stimulation and additional outgrowth can be revealed by repeated/alternative activations (Siliciano 2022; Wang et al. 2018; Hosmane et al. 2017; Laird et al. 2013) (1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2).
Thermodynamic limitations on viral protein evolution: experiments and theory show protein stability and stability‑mediated epistasis constrain accessible mutational paths and fitness, setting effective free‑energy boundaries on viral protein evolution (Gong et al. 2013; Wylie & Shakhnovich 2011; Zeldovich et al. 2007; Redondo et al. 2017; Klein et al. 2018) (4.1, 5.1, 5.2, 6.1, 7.1, 8.1).
RNA aptamers used for viral inhibition: multiple studies demonstrate RNA aptamers that directly inhibit HIV proteins (RT, protease, gp120) and/or deliver siRNAs to suppress replication in vitro and in vivo, with mechanistic evidence for aptamer encapsidation–mediated inhibition (Zhou et al. 2008; Neff et al. 2011; Zhou et al. 2013; Zhou et al. 2015; Duclair et al. 2015; Lange et al. 2017; reviews: Shum et al. 2013; Chakraborty et al. 2022) (9.1, 10.1, 11.1, 12.1, 13.1, 14.1, 15.1, 16.1).
